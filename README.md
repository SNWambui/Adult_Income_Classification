# Correlation-and-Regression
This contains code part of CS51 correlation and Regression assignment. 
Formulated the following research question based on the King County House Sales:
- Does the square feet of living space have a significant impact on the price of the house?

Using the sample data, determined the correlation between the two variables and created a predictive model to evaluate the price of any house in the larger population.
Performed the following analysis:
- Multilinear regression to determine the correlation of the variables, the residuals and the normal probability plot
- Wrote functions to calculate the:
  - Correlation coefficient
  - Coefficient of determination
  - Slope of the least squares line
  - Confidence interval of the least squares line
  - Regression equation that can be used to predict the price of the houses based on the square foot of living space
From the analysis, determined that the model was a good fit and square foot of living space is a good predictor of price
